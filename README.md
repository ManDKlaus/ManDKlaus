### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

  IÂ´m a passionate Full Stack Developer, obviusly. When IÂ´m not coding and building awesome web applications, you can find me indulging in my love for series and movies. IÂ´m a huge fan of classics like Pokemon, Naruto, and Dragon Ball, and IÂ´m always excited about the latest releases from the Marvel universe.
  
  Besides my love for technology, IÂ´m also an avid artist and designer. I enjoy sketching, drawing, and creating digital art. Designing beautiful and intuitive user interfaces is one of my favorite parts of the development process.
  
  My journey as a Full Stack Developer has been a thrilling one, and IÂ´m constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow. I believe in the power of technology to make a positive impact on peopleÂ´s lives, and thatÂ´s what drives me to work hard and deliver exceptional solutions.
  
  LetÂ´s connect and explore the possibilities of collaborating on exciting projects. Feel free to reach out to me anytime!
